Description: Implements novel weighting approaches for Matching-Adjusted Indirect
    Comparisons (MAIC) including entropy balancing with non-uniform base weights,
    alternative loss functions from the Cressie-Read divergence family, arm-separate
    weighting schemes, and combined adjustment methods for treatment switching and
    variance reduction. Based on methodological developments from Phillippo et al. (2020),
    Petto et al. (2019), Williamson et al. (2013), and Hainmueller (2012).
