Objectives
----------

Signorovitch (2010) describes MAIC that focuses on matching one study with individual patient data (IPD) to the covariates in one study with aggregated data (AGR). However in most scenarios there are likely to be multiple studies with IPD and AGR that need to be included in the Indirect Comparison. In addition it may be necessary to extend the network of treatments to include more than the two treatments with a single comparator.

Methods
-------

We propose a number of potential solutions for including multiple studies and multiple treatments in the MAIC and assess these using simulations with the weighting methods proposed by Signorovitch(2010) as well as with Entropy Balancing Hainmueller (2012)

Results
-------

When multiple IPD studies exist then MAIC can be conducted if you consider a)Pooling IPD studies, into one large study and match against the AGR study or b) matching each IPD study against the AGR study. For multiple AGR studies then the IPD data can be matched against a) just one AGR study, b) the average patient characteristics from the AGR studies, c) the average mean and variances from the AGR studies or d) the distribution of patient characteristics using MCMC from the AGR studies. To apply a MAIC in Networks involving multiple studies the choice of study to match on could be an issue so it is important that the assumptions surrounding the NMA are tested, and only if there is no evidence to suggest inconsistency and heterogeneity within the Network, should IPD studies be added to the Network via an MAIC.

Conclusions
-----------

MAIC can be applied in scenarios where you have multiple studies and treatments if the existing Network satisfies the assumptions around heterogeneity and inconsistency required when performing Network Meta-Analysis.
